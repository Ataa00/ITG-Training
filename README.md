# ITG-Training

*Branch Description:
This branch includes all files and folders that I practised to learn NodeJS and AWS.

*Task1: Git-Commands
---

**Task Description:

- Create a description for your Gitlab
- Rename master to main
- Create a new branch from main
- Edit your current practice work in the new branch to have a correct English
- Decorate README with the documentation of the idea(s) in detail behind your work for every folder in the new branch
- Create a PR for the new branch to main (we will cancel the PR later)
- Clear the contents of the main branch except for README.md/gitignore files
- Provide the commands for GIT for every point above

**Approach:
- First, I created a new branch called practice-work to push my practice work on it.  
  Using the following command:
  ```
  git checkout -b practice-work
  ```
- Secondly, I renamed the master branch to main branch.  
  Using the following command:
  ```
  git branch -m master main
  ```
  
**Files/Folders that can be ignored in README
- dependency caches, such as the contents of /node_modules or /packages
- compiled code, such as .o, .pyc, and .class files
- build output directories, such as /bin, /out, or /target
- files generated at runtimes, such as .log, .lock, or .tmp
- hidden system files, such as.DS_Store or Thumbs.db
- personal IDE config files, such as .idea/workspace.xml
